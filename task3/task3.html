        <p>Candy, also called sweets (British English) or lollies (Australian English, New Zealand English)
            ,[a] is a confection that features sugar as a principal ingredient.
             The category, called sugar confectionery, encompasses any sweet confection,<br>
              including chocolate, chewing gum, and sugar candy. Vegetables, fruit, or nuts which
               have been glazed and <br> coated with sugar are said to be candied.
            Physically, candy is characterized by the use of a significant<br> amount of sugar or 
            sugar substitutes. Unlike a cake or loaf of bread that would be shared among many people,<br>
            candies are usually made in smaller pieces. However, the definition of
             candy also depends  upon how people <br>treat the food. Unlike sweet pastries served for a dessert course at the 
            end of a meal, candies are normally<br> eaten casually, often with the fingers, as a snack
             between meals. Each culture has its own ideas <br>of what constitutes candy rather than dessert.
             The same food may be a candy in one culture and a dessert<br> in another.The word 
             candy entered the English language from the Old French Ã§ucre candi ("sugar candy").<br> The 
             French term probably has earlier roots in the Arabic qandi, Persian qand and Sanskrit khanda,
              all words<br> for sugar.

             Sugarcane is indigenous to tropical South and Southeast Asia.
              Pieces of sugar were produced by boiling sugarcane juice in ancient 
              India and consumed as khanda.
              [4][5][6][7][8] Between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, the Persians, 
              followed by the Greeks, discovered the people in India and their "reeds that
               produce honey without bees".
              They adopted and then spread sugar and sugarcane agriculture.
